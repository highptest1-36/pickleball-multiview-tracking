### 📈 Performance
```
🎯 ID switch rate: <2% (excellent)
👤 Average confidence: 85-95%
⚡ FPS: ~20-25 (GPU, overhead from appearance extraction)
📊 Assignment success: >95%
```

### ✅ Pros
- **Best ID stability** among all scripts

RE-ID METRICS:
  Total assignments: 8,543
  ID switches: 127
  Switch rate: 1.49%
  ID stability: 98.51%

TRACKER STATUS:
  P1: ACTIVE   | Conf: 95% | Miss: 0
  P2: ACTIVE   | Conf: 89% | Miss: 1
  P3: ACTIVE   | Conf: 87% | Miss: 2
  P4: ACTIVE   | Conf: 92% | Miss: 1
